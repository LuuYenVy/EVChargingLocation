# EV Charging Station Location Prediction in Ho Chi Minh City

This project aims to predict optimal locations for Electric Vehicle (EV) charging stations in **Ho Chi Minh City**, Vietnam. The goal is to analyze traffic patterns and identify potential areas that would be suitable for setting up EV charging stations. 

## Project Overview:
In this project, I utilized **Markov Models** to predict traffic flow, which plays a crucial role in identifying high-traffic areas that could benefit from EV charging stations. Additionally, I employed **classification algorithms** to determine whether specific locations are appropriate for installing charging stations based on various factors such as traffic volume and nearby Points of Interest (POIs).

## Data Sources:
- **OpenStreetMap (OSM):**  
  Used for the traffic network of Ho Chi Minh City, including road data and locations of various urban features.
- **Points of Interest (POIs):**  
  Data on various POIs such as fuel stations, residential areas, apartment buildings, supermarkets, shopping malls, office buildings, parking lots, and universities were collected to determine areas of high demand for EV charging.
- **Population Density Data:**  
  Population density data was sourced from [WorldPop Population Density for Vietnam](https://data.humdata.org/dataset/worldpop-population-density-for-viet-nam) to understand the distribution of potential users in different parts of the city.

## Key Features:
- **Traffic Flow Prediction:**  
  Using Markov Models to estimate traffic patterns in Ho Chi Minh City.
- **Location Suitability Analysis:**  
  Using classification algorithms to determine whether a specific location is suitable for an EV charging station.
- **Data Integration:**  
  Combining traffic data with population density and POIs to assess the best locations for charging infrastructure.

This project highlights my skills in **data science**, **machine learning**, and **geospatial analysis**, and demonstrates my ability to combine real-world datasets to solve urban mobility challenges.
